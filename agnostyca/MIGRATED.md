# 🚚 Agnostyca Platform Migrated

The Agnostyca platform has been moved to an **independent repository** to ensure proper GitHub contribution tracking.

## 📍 New Location

The platform is now located at:
```
/Users/walterkurz/Documents/0 Normal Business/1 Businesses /1 Cooperative/3 Agnostyca/git/agnostyca-platform/
```

## 🎯 Why the Move?

- **GitHub Contributions**: Fork structure didn't show contributions on your profile
- **Independence**: Clean separation from React Flow upstream
- **Proper Attribution**: Maintains React Flow licensing while establishing Agnostyca identity

## 🔗 What's Preserved

- ✅ All code and architecture
- ✅ React Flow attribution and licensing
- ✅ Git history via initial commit
- ✅ All documentation and instructions

## 📋 Next Steps

1. Work from the new location: `agnostyca-platform/`
2. This folder can be safely removed once you verify the migration
3. Continue development in the independent repository

The new repository is ready for:
- npm package publishing as `@agnostyca/platform`
- GitHub remote setup
- Independent development and contributions
