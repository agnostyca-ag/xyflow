# MVP Test Dashboard

This folder contains the **0-MVP-Test-Dashboard**, a demonstration dashboard for showcasing the platform's core concepts and UI/UX.

**Important:**
- This MVP is built on a separate tech stack for rapid prototyping and demonstration purposes.
- It is **not** intended for production use. The final production dashboard will be built with improved architecture, scalability, and security.
- Use this MVP to test and explore the platform's vision, but refer to the main repository for production-ready code and best practices.

## How to Test the MVP

1. Open a terminal and navigate to this folder:
	```bash
	cd 0-MVP-Test-Dashboard
	npm install
	npm run dev
	```
2. Visit the local URL shown in the terminal (e.g., http://localhost:5173 or similar).
3. Explore the dashboard features and UI widgets.

For questions or feedback, please refer to the main repository README or contact the project maintainers.

# Swissi Federated Dashboard Platform

## 💡 **The Big Idea: Universal Foundation + Domain Specialization**

This platform embodies a revolutionary approach to software architecture: **build once, specialize everywhere**. 

### **🏗️ Core Philosophy**

We maintain **one universal foundation** that powers infinite domain-specific applications:

- **🧠 AI Layer**: Universal AI orchestration and model management
- **📊 DAG (Data + Analytics + Governance)**: Unified data processing and governance
- **🔗 DAG Network**: Layer 1 (commercial) and Layer 2 (academic/non-commercial) transactions
- **⚡ Backend Foundation**: Scalable, federated microservices architecture  
- **🎨 Frontend Foundation**: Universal widget system and UI components

**All new developments and improvements happen at this foundational layer**, benefiting every domain simultaneously.

### **🎯 Domain Specialization Strategy**

Built on this foundation, we create **domain-specific layers** for:
- **🎓 Education**: Universities, research institutions, academic collaboration
- **💰 Finance**: Trading platforms, investment management, DeFi
- **🏥 Healthcare**: Patient data, medical research, compliance
- **🏢 Enterprise**: Business intelligence, analytics, operations
- **🌍 Public Sector**: Government services, transparency, citizen engagement

**Customizations and domain-specific functions live in these specialized layers**, while the core remains universal and continuously improved.

### **🚀 Developer Impact**

- **One codebase to master**: Learn the foundation, work across all domains
- **Shared improvements**: Features built for education automatically benefit finance
- **Rapid domain expansion**: New verticals launch in weeks, not months
- **Zero vendor lock-in**: Complete sovereignty over your technology stack

## 🎯 Core Principles

### 1. **Zero Vendor Lock-in**
- All services can be self-hosted
- Open source components only
- Standard protocols and APIs
- Database and storage agnostic

### 2. **Federation-Ready**
- Peer-to-peer network architecture
- Distributed consensus mechanisms
- Cross-federation data sharing
- Privacy-preserving protocols

### 3. **Self-Sovereign Infrastructure**
- Own your data completely
- Run your own AI models
- Manage your own blockchain nodes
- Control your own federation

### 4. **Horizontal Scalability**
- Microservices architecture
- Container-native design
- Kubernetes-ready manifests
- Auto-scaling capabilities

## 🚀 Tech Stack
